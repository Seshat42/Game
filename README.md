# Alien Miner

A complex HTML5 game inspired by classic digging adventures. You control a mining
pod on an alien planet, searching for valuable resources and mysterious
artifacts.

The world now scrolls horizontally and features multiple resource types. Player
progress is saved between sessions and upgrades can be purchased at the shop.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

direction.
